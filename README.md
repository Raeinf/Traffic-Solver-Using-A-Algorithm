# Traffic-Solver-Using-A*-Algorithm

## Overview

This project provides a Python-based implementation of the A* algorithm to solve traffic puzzles. The goal is to navigate vehicles on a grid to allow a target car (red car) to reach the exit. The solution computes the optimal sequence of moves, minimizing the total cost based on the number of moves required.
